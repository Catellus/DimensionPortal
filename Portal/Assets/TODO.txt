DONE (181011) - Added (181011) - Add ability to see into other worlds
DONE (190311) - Added (181011) - Add camera settings scriptable object to automatically update cameras that enter that world's index (clear color, post process, etc)
Done?(190311) - Added (181011) - Fix world switching timing; currently will change worlds before the view mesh is flipped over the portal (camera system's fault?) NOTE: Did not notice this occurring during this commit
Done?(190314) - Added (190311) - untangle the code; Add better managers NOTE: Only edited camera scripts. Should return to this later.
Done (190314) - Added (190313) - Edit ViewQuadManipulator to morph the quad based on player position not playerCamera position. (Will need to adjust quad's relative position as its position is relative to camera.)

TODO          - Added (190314) - Add player ability to place the portal (Maybe on cursor position with ability to rotate with mouse wheel?)

TODO          - Added (190314) - Add infrastructre to allow objects' visuals to morph when passing through a portal (only part of its body visible in the new/old world)
TODO          - Added (190314) - Allow multiple portals to be on-screen at one time
TODO          - Added (190314) - Handle stacking portal-views (viewing portals through portals)
